# Week 1


### What have I done?
* Chose topic and algorithms to implement
* Java-project created
* Documention created

### Learned?
* About location-allocation problem in general
* P-median as a distinct location-allocation problem
* Algorithms for solving the p-median problem  

### Unclear/difficult?  
* The complexity of chosen algorithms. Did not have time to think about worst cases yet. It's clear why the actual problem is NP-hard though.  
* Unclear how the algorithms actually work. A few decent sources describing them found.


### Next week?
* Implement brute force solution for benchmarking using enumeration
* Have a working (but likely ugly) implementation of Teitz-Bart
* If time: A simple input/output system to ease testing of actual cases

# Week 5

## What have I done?
* Created a class for testing quality and performance of algorithms.
* Created a markdown report for automatic reporting of results of quality/performance tests.
* A class replacing Java's ArrayList (noted in peer review)

## Learned?
* About running performance simulations.
* Seems that GRIA outperforms TeitzBart on runtime, quality is equal
* Both GRIA and TeitzBart provide *very nearly* optimal solutions

## Unclear/difficult?  
* Should the performance/quality tests be a part of other (unit) tests in the project? Running them with each build seems tiresome, but maybe they can be excluded? What's the best practise here?

## Next week?
* Better, more exhaustive tests (based on peer review)
* Exception handling (based on peer preview)
* Start work on GUI

## Hours spent: Approx. 14h.
